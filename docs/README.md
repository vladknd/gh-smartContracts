# GreenHero Coin (GHC) Smart Contracts

A comprehensive Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) project for the GreenHero Coin educational platform. This project implements a "Pre-Mint & Allocate" tokenomics model where users earn GHC tokens by completing educational activities.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project consists of 5 core smart contracts (canisters):

### Core Financial & Governance Canisters

- **ghc_ledger** - ICRC-1 compliant token ledger recording all balances and transfers.
- **staking_hub** - Central custodian holding the "Mined Utility Partition" (4.1B tokens), managing user subaccounts, and handling staking/mining logic.
- **operational_governance** - Manages the Treasury (3.6B tokens) and handles spending proposals.
- **content_governance** - Manages educational content proposals (whitelisting books/NFTs).

### Educational Canisters

- **learning_engine** - Manages quizzes, user progress, and verifies learning activities to trigger rewards.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [dfx](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install) (Internet Computer SDK)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (optional, for frontend integration)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd gh-smartContracts

# Install dfx if not already installed
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

### Deploy Locally

```bash
# Start local replica and deploy all canisters
./deploy.sh
```

## 📚 Documentation

## 🛠️ Management & Verification

### Run Comprehensive Tests

The project includes a comprehensive test script that verifies the entire flow, including deployment, initialization, and interaction between canisters.

```bash
./comprehensive_test.sh
```

### Test Specific Flows

```bash
# Test the quiz and reward flow
./test_quiz_flow.sh

# Test general system flow
./test_flow.sh
```

### Load Initial Data

```bash
# Load learning materials into the Learning Engine
./load_data.sh
```

### 🔄 Interaction Details

**1. Mining Flow ("Virtual Staking")**
The interaction between `learning_engine` and `staking_hub` is designed for maximum efficiency and user experience:
1.  **Verify**: User submits quiz answers to `learning_engine`.
    *   **Passing Threshold**: Must answer at least **60%** correctly (e.g., 3/5).
    *   **Daily Limit**: Users can take up to **5 quizzes per day**.
2.  **Auto-Stake**: If correct, `learning_engine` calls `staking_hub.stake_rewards(user, amount)`.
3.  **Instant Utility**: The user's "Virtual Balance" in the Staking Hub is immediately updated. This balance **counts as Voting Power** instantly.
4.  **No Gas Fees**: There is no interaction with the `ghc_ledger` at this stage. The tokens remain in the Staking Hub's main account on the Ledger, but are logically attributed to the user internally.

**2. Interest Payouts (Monthly Dividends)**
The system incentivizes long-term holding through a "Lazy Distribution" model:
*   **Collection**: When a user unstakes, a **10% penalty** is deducted and added to a `Pending Interest Pool`.
*   **Distribution Rounds**: Periodically (e.g., monthly), an admin triggers a distribution. This moves the accumulated penalties into a `Cumulative Reward Index`.
*   **Lazy Payout**: Users do not see their balance change instantly. Instead, the next time they interact (mine, vote, or unstake), their balance is automatically updated based on the `Reward Index` growth since their last interaction. This allows O(1) scalability for millions of users.

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### Run Integration Tests

Use the provided shell scripts to run integration tests against a local replica:

```bash
# Verify local deployment and flows
./comprehensive_test.sh
```

### Manual Verification

You can interact with the canisters using `dfx`:

```bash
# Check Staking Hub status
dfx canister call staking_hub get_stats

# Check Ledger Balance
dfx canister call ghc_ledger icrc1_balance_of "(record { owner = principal \"...\" })"

# Check Learning Engine Stats
dfx canister call learning_engine get_stats
```

## 🔐 Security

- **Stable Structures**: Uses `ic-stable-structures` for scalable and safe memory management.
- **Governance Control**: Treasury and Content decisions are managed via governance canisters.
- **Access Control**: Critical functions in `staking_hub` are restricted to specific caller canisters (e.g., `learning_engine`).
