## Quick Summary

The GreenHero governance system now uses:

1. **Basis Points (BPS)** instead of percentages for higher precision (0.01% granularity)
2. **A Sentinel Role** for enabling "board member approval" without affecting outcomes
3. **Cumulative Partitioning** for zero-dust voting power calculations
4. **Largest Remainder Method** for fair redistribution

See the new documentation for complete details.
