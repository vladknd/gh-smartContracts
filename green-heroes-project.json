      "content": "Artificially Conceptual Value (ACV) refers to a technical feature that lacks scientific evidence to support its effectiveness in real-life applications but is marketed in a way that convinces people it works. Companies engaged in promoting ACVs often introduce scientific explanations to justify their technologies, which may seem plausible to consumers without in-depth knowledge. This can lead to the adoption of technologies that do not contribute effectively to sustainability but are perceived to be valuable innovations. For example, heat reflective technology claims to reflect body heat to conserve warmth, but tests show minimal difference in thermal efficiency. Similarly, phase-change materials (PCMs) are marketed for their temperature-regulating properties, but the scale and activation conditions of PCMs often make them impractical for everyday textile applications. Furthermore, many performance claims associated with ACVs, such as health benefits from heat-generating technology, are unsupported when tested under realistic conditions. These ACVs not only mislead consumers but also pose environmental challenges, as unnecessary chemical treatments complicate recycling processes and contribute to environmental pollution.",
